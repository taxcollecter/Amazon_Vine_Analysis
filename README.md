# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

Overview of the analysis:
In this exercise we’ve been tasked with analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. We’ll retrieve the products and their reviews to review how the program is functioning.

Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:
How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
94, 40471
How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
48, 15663
What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
51.063%, 38.701%

Summary: In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use the results of your analysis to support your statement. Then, provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.
